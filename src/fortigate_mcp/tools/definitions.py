Parameters:
- device_id: Identifier of the FortiGate device (e.g., "FG-E", "FG-F")
- name: Object name (e.g., "Web-Server", "*.example.com")
- address_type: One of ipmask, iprange, fqdn, wildcard-fqdn, geography
- address: Value formatted per type:
    ipmask       → "10.0.0.0/24"
    iprange      → "10.0.0.1-10.0.0.100"
    fqdn         → "*.example.com" or "api.example.com"
    wildcard-fqdn→ "*.example.com"
    geography    → "CN"

TYPE-SPECIFIC NOTES:
- type=fqdn with wildcard value ("*.example.com"): since FortiOS 6.2.2,
  this can serve as firewall/proxy policy srcaddr/dstaddr AND as
  SSL/SSH profile inspection exemption. Preferred for policy domain
  objects.
- type=wildcard-fqdn: also a firewall/address object (NOT the same as
  firewall/wildcard-fqdn/custom). Can be used in policies (6.2.2+).
- To create SSL-exempt-only wildcard FQDN objects (NOT usable in
  policies), use the create_wildcard_fqdn_custom tool instead — those
  go to cmdb/firewall/wildcard-fqdn/custom and are referenced only
  in ssl-ssh-profile → ssl-exempt.

Returns:
- Creation status
- Object configuration summary
